# Minify CSS
CSS is minified with the fantastic [clean-css](https://github.com/GoalSmashers/clean-css) library. The direct compiler takes a hash of options just like accord does. You can see the [options that can be passed here](https://github.com/GoalSmashers/clean-css#how-to-use-clean-css-programmatically).

## Supported Methods
 - render

## Source Maps

Clean CSS does not yet have support for source maps, but it is [in the works](https://github.com/jakubpawlowicz/clean-css/issues/125) at the time of writing. We will re-examine if/when this feature is fully implemented.
