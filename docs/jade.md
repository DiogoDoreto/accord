# Jade
The jade adapter is used in just about the exact same as the jade public api, making this adapter a very easy transition. Jade takes the [options listed here under "options"](http://jade-lang.com/api/) and they are fed through directly.

## Supported Methods
 - render
 - compile
 - compileClient
 - clientHelpers

## Source Maps

Jade does not support source maps and has no plans of doing so in the near future. See [this issue](https://github.com/jadejs/jade/issues/941) for discussion.
